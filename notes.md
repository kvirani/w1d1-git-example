W1D1 - Git Lecture / Breakout
=================

## Topics to cover

* Markdown (for notes)
* Gists

### Git vs Github

Version control. Collaborate on the same source code and even the same files and all the history, as long as the dev is using commits, is persisted so you can go back in time, and sync, etc. 

More powerful and advanced Dropbox for developers. 

Github is basically just an interface for Git. 

### Remotes

A destination URL where we can push changes to or pull changes from. While you can have a git repo without a remote, if that's the case then it's just code on your local machine. 

* Branches
* Forking (Git vs Github)
* Command line
