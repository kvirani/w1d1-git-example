W1D1 - Git Lecture / Breakout
=================

## Topics to cover in Breakout

* Markdown (for notes)
* Gists

### Git vs Github

Version control. Collaborate on the same source code and even the same files and all the history, as long as the dev is using commits, is persisted so you can go back in time, and sync, etc. 

More powerful and advanced Dropbox for developers. 

Github is basically just an interface for Git. 

### Remotes

A destination URL where we can push changes to or pull changes from. While you can have a git repo without a remote, if that's the case then it's just code on your local machine. 

Dealing with remote (push / pull) is the only part where you need to be connected. Commits and other commands are all local. 

## Cloning = ?

The first pull from the remote server. 

Cloning is basically a mkdir + git init + git remote add + git pull

In this case, the newly created local folder is already fulled in sync with the remote copy, and also linked with the remote (origin)

### Forking (Git vs Github)

Github is the interface but also the remote server to put our code on. We have our profiles + repos under our account.

You can clone anything that's publicly available on github. 

Public repos (or even secret gists, etc) are owned by an account andi t wouldn't make sense to allow ANYONE to PUSH changes. It would be chaos. You need a permission system. 

Forking is a github feature where you can create a server-side clone of the repo, under YOUR account.
